Problems faced while development through web3js:
     
   1. Do not know the beginning point
     
    1.network setup:net
    2.Thinking perspective:[Architecture]
      1.one user: It will take address for the client to be transacted and vice versa. From here onwarwards, layers addition
      will let to architecture build based on consensus and security.
      2.Using of web3js APIs: it will lead to security build + consensus mechanism.
      3.Transaction Mechanism to be followed:
    Alice, Bob and Carol:
         Bob(+$10)         --------->Alice(-$10)
         Carol($10)        --------->Bob(+$10-$10=$0)
         Alice(-$10+$10=$0)--------->Carol($10-$10=$0)
         
   2. What will be stepwise architecture for web3js building?
