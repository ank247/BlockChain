Hi All,

Here is my GPD review for the session.(2019-20)

1)Presentations to team, management on upcoming topics in blockchain technology stack
> Recognized by Project Manager for embraced change in ideation based on Technology and Business value for Decentralized IoT.
> Demonstrated innovative Techno and business perspective for blockchain enabled hardware.
> Demonstrated a comparative business analysis for the use case proposed with the existing startup lists.
> Compared Smartcard theory(RTOS) with the hardware oracle in the discussion.


2)Participating in Co-Innovation project discussions, design thinking workshops, and innovation sprints
> Multiple innovative discussions with PO, AM and Tech Lead based on project components such as flashing devices(ESP32), 
Networking Methodology (light client), hardware devices, Telematics softwares and Tracking devices.
> Multiple design demonstrations through existing products like YouTube backups, YouTube downloaders and IoT protocols.

3) Participating in collaborative development with Global Teams (Internal and External)
a) Co-innovate, co-create global teams and contribute in asset creation or building Platform
> Frequent demonstration of use cases among POs (ETL internally) for any use cases derived from on going projects. 

4) Participate in Hackathons/Meetups
a) Conduct sessions in Meetups 
> A meeting held with DH and POs for new ideation in blockchain technology.
> Demonstrated value to blockchain technology through Research Papers implementation from cryptology journal, IACR, for new ideas and improving strength in blockchain stack.

b)Hackathon participation
> Participated in ideation round proposed by PO in Bosch IoT Hackathon with the team of 4 members.




IP and Asset creation:

1) Demonstrated 3 different ideations for Patents:
1. An approach to enhance profit in product through blockchain using Proof of Work
2. Technology expect of Raft consensus | Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance
3. The Ant Problem based on Zero Knowledge of Proof




Technical Certification:
1) IBM Blockchain Essentials V2 
> complete knowledge for TradeLens, a Tracking Product of IBM.
2) IBM Hyperfabric Composer
> Completed a short project on TradeLens tracking using Hyperfabric Composer.

Certified: https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/d9b57211-30b3-4424-aeea-4253a1047600/linked_in

Consensus:
1) Kafka/Zoo-keeper
2) Proof-of-Work
3) Proof-of-Stake
4) Raft/IBFT

Coding Languages:
1) C/C++
2) Nodejs
3) Solidity
4) Web3




1) Agile Mindset (Participation in Agile Ceremonies)
> Attented around 95% agile sprints, meetings. 

Trainings:
1. Javascript
2. Advanced Javascript
3. Git
4. Linux
5. Object Oriented Programming
6. Design Patterns

Mandatory Trainings:
1. ISP-ISP001
2. ISP-ISP002
3. ISP-ISP005-DoCONF-PersData
4. ISP - ISP 042
5. RBEI-QM-WBT007

2) Continuous improvements
> Initially, I was new to javascript. It gave me few hard times for not getting attracted to product owners. But with the time, 
   I could demonstrate 5 demos on Nodejs(Advanced Javascript) that included complete architecture in span of around 5 weeks.
> It included use of Expressjs and Web3, which are written nodejs.

3) Operational Excellence Index
> Using Nodejs, I could control the scalability and reliability for the raft project. This is a live milestone achievement for me.




1)Work on Low Level Design of Platform Components[5 layered architecture]
• demonstrated a demo of raft consensus over distributed network with real-time functionalities of node-events, transactions among nodes in nodejs.
• developed from scratch a decentralised network with main-server(super-admin) having unique IP-address and port, sub-servers(admin) with the 
same IP-address that of super-admin with different ports and users each having different IPs on their corresponding port assigned in nodejs. 

2)Constantly work, review and refine components in components assigned along with Smart ways of development, automation, etc.
• enhanced performance of the consensus through worker threads and cpu scheduling approach for improved data processing using buffer array reduction.
• scaled the simultaneous network events to 100k users from 1k users through shared memory method.

Demo:

1. Multithreading process communication: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EEc7sHOWrQ&t=134s

2. An enterprise broadcasting system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRySFFkwqq0&t=11s

3. Transaction over broadcasting system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBhhivgdo-E&t=21s

4. An enterprise broadcast | Different ports on same IPs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NZyJa7gHPE

Additional projects:

1. developed an enterprise restful expressjs API product for reliable data fetching to each nodes written in solidity contracts with web3 as backend. [1 layered architecture]

2. developed an enterprise restful expressjs API in nodejs. [ 2 layered architecture]

3. developed ecdsa library on preprocessor level in c/c++ for hardware wallet for tracking purpose.
