# BlockChain
Neural Network based Blockchain


1.Transactions:

Challenges:

    1. Verification of Double-Spend(Multiple signing of the same block) check on Transactions
    
Solution: 

         1. The Transactions should use third-party for verification.
         2. The majority of nodes agree with the received transaction is first by the following Payee. 

2.Timestamp Server:

Solution for Double-Spend:
    
    1. The timestamp attached indicates that the Transaction would have been signed at some earlier timestamp.
    
3.Proof-of-Work:

Target:
    
    1. Increase difficulty for Proof-of-Work so that the transactions stored in blocks by each node could be 
       allowed to passby other participating nodes.

Solution for:
 
    1. Determining representation in majority decision making.
  
Challenges:
    
    1.If 1-IP 1-Vote given for majority, multiple IPs comes into picture by a single client.
    2.The compensation in hardware speed and varying in interest of speed of blocks for nodes 
      leads to difficulty of Proof-of-Work(PoW).  
    
Solution:[Dominancy][Super-admin concept creation]

    1. 1-CPU-1-Vote: CPU power allocation to the one-honest node reduces capability of adversary nodes by CPU-power.
    2. For decremention of PoW for hardware speed of honest node, there is fixing of average nos. of blocks per hour. 

4. Network Setup:
   
   
       1.
